I am a PhD student at the [College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University](https://coi.hzau.edu.cn/) (2022-), advised by Professor [Hong Chen](https://chenhongml.github.io/). I obtained my M.S. degree at the College of Science, Huazhong Agricultural University (2020-2022) and my B.S. degree at the School of Mathmatics, Taiyuan University of Technology (2016-2020). I previously visited the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, advised by Professor [Yong Liu](https://liuyonggsai.github.io/chinese/).

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the theory and application of machine learning, particularly in statistical machine learning theory, unsupervised learning, federated learning, and their applications in agriculture and space physics.
