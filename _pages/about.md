I am a PhD student at the [College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University](https://coi.hzau.edu.cn/) (2022.9-), advised by Professor [Hong Chen](https://chenhongml.github.io/). I obtained my M.S. degree at the College of Science, Huazhong Agricultural University (2020.9-2022.6) and my B.S. degree at the School of Mathmatics, Taiyuan University of Technology (2016.9-2020.6). I previously visited the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China, advised by Professor [Yong Liu](https://liuyonggsai.github.io/chinese/). I will go to the University of Sydney for a joint PhD program of Chinese Government Scholarship to Study Abroad, advised by Professor [Yiming Ying](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/yiming-ying.html).

💻 Research Interests 💻
======
My research interests lie in the theory and application of machine learning, particularly in statistical machine learning theory, unsupervised learning, federated learning, and their applications in agriculture and space physics.
